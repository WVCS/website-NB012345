    <p1> Hello! My name is Nidhi Baratam. I was born on September 17, and currently 15 years old. I am now a sophomore at <br> Westview High School. I was born in Hyderabad, India. I have a older sister named Nitya, who is going to college right now and is <br> three years older than me. I moved to London after staying in India for a year. After living in London for approximately for three <br> years, my family moved to San Diego. We moved because my dad's job caused my family to have to move here. I like to do <br> photography, dance, spend time with family and friends, and watch movies. My favorite color is forest green! <br> I used to gymnastics during elementry and middle school. I quit gymnastics after Covid-19 started, and did not resume <br> after it cooled down.
